Students will make a belt, and then bags and holsters (water bottle, cellphone, etc.) for it. The belts will involve primarily riveted construction while some of the bag and holster projects will be sewn. Projects will focus on functional design work and learn how to wet-form leather. Students will make flat bags and then create depth by stretching them from within. They will have the option to make it a handbag, clutch, kit, or fanny pack and will have thee option to personalize them with stamps, embossing, and dye work.
