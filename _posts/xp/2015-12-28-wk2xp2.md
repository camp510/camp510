## Casting Collectives

It takes many hands to create a successful mold to cast with. Join us for a crash course in casting and mold making. Working together, and individually, campers will learn loads of fun new techniques for casting and mold making, using exciting materials such as alginate, plaster, cement, silicone, and clay. Anything can be casted, from your hands to your feet to your favorite fruit! We will do exciting experimentations to create fun and unique pieces of art that the campers can bring home and even recreate! Be prepared to get dirty, because the process is messy, but the product(s) are well worth it!
