##Lath!

In this Woodworking XP with instructor Wendy Renz, CAMPers will work with lath (100-year old salvaged wood from Oakland homes), compound miter saws, sanders and nail guns, paint, stain and wax to create wall hangings of their own design. Students will learn the entire process from drawing a geometric design inspired by nature, landscape or whatever is in their imagination, to making frames, to parquetry wood working techniques (measuring, cutting, mitering and fitting pieces of wood together) within the frame, to finishing techniques using paints, stains and waxes to bring the design alive with color and tone! CAMPers will be able to create at least two lath wall hangings--as simple introductory one where the frame is already prepared for the students, and another more complicated one where the students will build their own frames and execute a more complicated design. All materials will be provided.
