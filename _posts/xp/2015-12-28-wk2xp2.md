## Mosaic 

Contribute to the Oakland Mosaic Garbage can legacy! Campers will learn about mosaic tools, installation, and history of the Oakland mosaic garbage cans. We will apply the mosaic tiles to mosaic mesh in the classroom and on the final day install the mosaic on one of the city garbage cans in the surrounding neighborhood.
