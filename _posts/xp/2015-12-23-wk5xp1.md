## SINGfinity: Sound-games, Art-Scores, Singing

There’s more to singing than merely memorizing melodies, and there’s more to writing music than the traditional lines and dots we usually think of. In this playful workshop, we'll explore the infinity of sound we can create, using only our breath and our voice. We’ll also learn how to shape sound by creating playful musical art-scores. Over the course of the week, kids will create their very own sound scores, like a six-sided dice score that we’ll roll to determine which sounds to make next, or a deck of cards score that we’ll use to create different sound games with, …and more!
