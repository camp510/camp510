**_Stained Glass Window Studio_**

Glass! Molten metal! Colored light! In this Glassworks XP with instructor Dave Dawson, CAMPers will be working with solder, patina, glass and copper to create free-hanging stained-glass windows of their own design. We will be doing the entire process - from drawing a pattern and choosing colors through cutting, taping, soldering patination and framing. CAMPers can expect to complete at least two windows - a simple introductory design using rectangular pieces of glass, and another more complex design with curved cuts. Join us and practice developing a steady hand and using your eye for detail and design.
