**_CERAMICS_**
CAMPers explore concepts of revealing and obscuring through mask-making or  making a container for a special object. 

Masks have been used both to conceal the identity of the wearer and to connect the wearer to an aspirational power or characteristic. Vessels of all kinds have a dual potential as well. They can be repositories for secret or sacred objects whose outer markings tell the story of what they contain or they can mislead the viewer to hide something precious, or elevate something mundane.
