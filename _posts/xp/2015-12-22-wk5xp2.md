###Calling all Pinball Wizards!


CAMPers build a wooden pinball machine complete with plunger, bumpers, apron, and ramps. We will focus on refining design decisions and learn about proper techniques for use of handheld and power woodshop tools. Pinball machines will be painted to complement the function of the machine.

*XP CAMPS are open to CAMPers entering grades 5-8*
