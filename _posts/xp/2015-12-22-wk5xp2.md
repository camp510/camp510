**_CERAMICS_**
With a focus on designing and building character masks this week, campers will be introduced to the basics of hand-building ceramic objects. We will experiment with form and texture by utilizing different techniques for building and surface design, including carving and using found objects to press into the clay surface. CAMPers are invited to explore and develop their creativity by taking their ideas from concept to realization in 3 dimensional form.
