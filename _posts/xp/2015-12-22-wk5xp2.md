### Sewing

CAMPers will start the week creating custom fabric samples using a variety of surface design techniques-  block printing, embroidery, fabric painting, and applique’.  We’ll test our creations on a few custom accessories like zippered pouches and bags.  We’ll then move onto drafting a garment based on body measurements to make one of a kind art garments.
