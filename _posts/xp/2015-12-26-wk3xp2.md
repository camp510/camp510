###Build a kinetic, Rube-Goldberg-like machine!

CAMPers learn how to build complex machines, and how to link their different stages together to build complex structures. This program will be mainly LEGO-based, but will also draw from a variety of materials and resources that are non-LEGO. Our builders and engineers will be challenged to employ inquiry and problem-solving skills at every turn, as well as design thinking.

Maker Neil Aho has been playing with LEGOs, and building complex LEGO-based machines his whole life. See some of them in action on his website here: https://neilahoscience.wordpress.com/science-in-action/

Note: This XP project is four days long and runs from 9am-4pm.

*XP CAMPS are open to CAMPers entering grades 5-8*
