### Bookbinding

In this week long intensive, students will learn to construct a real hardbound book from scratch! Choose your inside papers, mix up styles and designs. Design your covers with colored book cloth or learn to turn any fabric into book cloth. Students who took this class last summer may opt to explore more complex structures if they wish. 

We will also be making our own book presses out of scrap wood, bolts, and other bits and pieces. Sand and finish your wooden press or paint it brightly with acrylic paints. 

This class is appropriate for any kid that likes to put things together, get messy, get focused, be creative, and have fun!
