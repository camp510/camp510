Technology is becoming wearable, sewable, and washable!  For the first time, XP CAMPers can do some Rogue Making and create their own tech wearables!  Pull from our fabric selection or bring your own garment to enhance with electronics.  Possible projects are concert/sports fanwear, bike turn-signal jacket, activewear for nighttime, pet wearables, or anything else the campers can invent! 

Please Note! This is a 4-day camp week and the XP project will run from 9am-4pm, Tuesday through Friday.
