**_3D Architectural Building_**
CAMPers will learn about the built environment. Considering the key concepts include site, style, materials, and function, we will create drawings in perspective, design floor plans, and build 3-D models. Each CAMPer will design and build a scaled architectural model. CAMPers can also explore Catitecture; -- working in teams to design, build, and decorate these fully functional Pawsome Palaces!

 
Please Note! This is a 4-day camp week and the XP project will run from 9am-4pm, Monday, and Wednesday through Friday. (CAMP is closed on Tuesday the 4th)
