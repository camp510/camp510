###Music and Video
(aka make short films for the CAMP 510 film festival)

In this XP project, CAMPers will learn--or explore more deeply!!--filmmaking and editing techniques that we will use to make as many short films as possible in one week of camp.! We will watch examples, brainstorm, storyboard, shoot, edit and amaze ourselves. We will also be learning the importance of musical scoring in film and will make our own soundtracks for the film. Let's learn about foley arts, camera angles, lighting, and time lapse. Let's bend time thru the magic of video. Let's do some stunts. Let's watch our dailies and screen final films for friends and family at the end of the week in the CAMP 510 Short-Film Film Festival! Can we do all of this in one week?!... Let's find out! 

Note: This project day runs from 9am to 4pm.
