## The Upturned Table

Cooking delicious food with a fantastical whimsical approach. Each camper will be invited to bring family recipes from home that we will use as a starting point for wild invention. We will invent new recipes, learn basic cooking skills and come up with fun and unusual ways to express ourselves through flavor, texture, smell, shape and color. The week will culminate in an inspired and creative meal made by campers for friends and family to enjoy.
