## Art Can Change the World

Together we will explore topics most important to each camper... the environment, equal rights, justice for all, peace, healing the planetâ€”anything that sparks our passionate engagement with the world. After defining some area of interest, CAMPers learn silk screen, hand stenciling, applique, embroidery and quilt making techniques to make empowered fabric banners, Tshirts, buttons, and more.
