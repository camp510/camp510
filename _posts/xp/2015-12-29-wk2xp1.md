### Sewing and Garment Construction

CAMPers disassemble old blue jeans to up-cycle into a myriad of projects. This will warm up our design muscles as we move onto garment construction. CAMPers create a custom garment based on their measurements. Weâ€™ll draft the pattern, create a muslin, and sew the final garment. This is also an open sewing studio for those interested in making complex bags, toys, and whatever else your imagination inspires you to do.
