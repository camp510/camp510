##The Way Things Move

CAMPers learn the basics for both live-action and stop-motion, and utilize these approaches to realize a video project. 
 
This project covers how to operate various cameras, how to use lights, record sound, and plan a shoot. CAMPers make and use storyboards, use stop motion capture software, problem-solve while making  animations, edit their clips and export a video to the web.
