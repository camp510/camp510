**_Table Shop_**

## ALMOST SOLD OUT!


Make a beautiful and useful piece of furniture! Learn about wood and woodworking! Campers in this XP will design, build, finish and take home a small wood table (end-table size). They will work with a range of tools, including a radial arm saw, sanders, biscuit cutters, drills, and clamps. The tables will be built from a variety of colorful hardwoods, selected and arranged by the campers. Note: This is an intensive camp, and will require that focus on safety and work productively during the week to get their projects finished.
