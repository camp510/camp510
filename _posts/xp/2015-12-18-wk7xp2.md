##The Summer Chef

Experience transformation, innovation and creativity through the bounty of summer food. CAMPers will learn to approach ingredients with confidence in this hands-on cooking class. They will develop knife skills, learn to balance flavors, adapt recipes from around the world, try new foods, and explore the chemical science mysteries of successful baking. The week will culminate with chef-teams drawing on their newly acquired knowledge and skills to create their own concoctions from a variety of secret ingredients. The culinary focus of the week will be local and seasonal foods with mountains fun and deliciousness from around the world and right at home.
