**_Electronics_**

We will merge the world of basic electronics and sound by creating projects involving light, environmental and mechanical sounds, and our ability to listen.  First we will learn new skills including soldering, electronics, and learning to record unusual sounds that surround our everyday lives. By the end of the session, we will work in small groups to create an audio-visual collage based on our findings and set them in motion with sound responsive lights.
