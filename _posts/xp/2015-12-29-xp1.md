**Homemade Analogue Synthesizer**
This week, CAMPers become members of a 30-piece orchestra of homemade musical synthesizers. These simple but mighty devices are easy to use and offer infinite fun, noisy possibilities for sonic creations. In this workshop, **_composer Danny Clay_** will lead students through activities, performances, and meditations. Students will use the instruments to build their own sound installations, invent games, and create their own musical compositions.


**$470**

*15 spaces for CAMPers entering grades 5-8*
