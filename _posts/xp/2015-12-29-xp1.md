## Cooking: The Upturned Table

Come learn knife skills, flavor combinations, and general cooking mechanics, techniques and secrets, while exploring the whimsy of the imaginative palate!
Burrito ravioli, bread pancakes and basil vanilla pudding cake - these are just a couple of dishes that have come about during previous summers in “The Upturned Table”, a week of cooking with a whimsical approach. Each CAMPer will be asked to bring family recipes from home that we will use as a starting point for wild invention. We will invent new recipes, learn basic cooking skills and come up with fun and unusual ways to express ourselves through flavor, texture, smell, shape and color. The week will culminate in an inspired and creative meal made by campers for friends and family to enjoy.
