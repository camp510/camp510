#Behemoths

Dinosaurs, monsters and beasts! Build creature sculptures as tall as yourself!

We’ll start by looking at dinosaur skeletons, and then build armatures out of wood and metal, based on what we learn about bones. Then we’ll give our creations nylon skins and fabulous coloring.

Make a watch-dragon for your front yard, or a velociraptor guard for your bedroom! We’ll be using a band saw, hand saws, drills, hammers and staple guns to create our new friends; you’ll be using your design and tool skills and learning some new ones, too.

This project is available as an ambitious and engaged one-week XP; or, if you really want to get into it, you can take it for two weeks and make a bigger, more elaborate beast with fabulously detailed features like scales, teeth and shining eyes.

CAMPers can sign up for a two week mega-behemoth session, Weeks 7 & 8, August 1-12, or either of the two weeks for a one week project: Week 7, August 1-5 or Week 8, August 8-12.
