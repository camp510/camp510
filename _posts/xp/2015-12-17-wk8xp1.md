**_Music Video Re-Production_**

CAMPers will re-create a music video. The process of discovering, recreating and reverse-engineering complex editing processes seen in their favorite music videos can lead to deep learning and experimental storytelling. CAMPers will form small groups to create a small video production crew; developing the ability to work collaboratively as a team member is the most effective way to become a filmmaker.Â
