### Illustration and Comics
CAMPers will be introduced to the process, tools and technique for creating their own comic story as they learn about different text/ image relationships, panel to panel transitions, layout and panel structure. From writing, through sketching to inking, CAMPers will incorporate these concepts into their own creations and will follow this unique process to tap into their own creativity and explore new exciting ways to bring stories to life.
