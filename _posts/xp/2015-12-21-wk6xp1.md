##Sewing and Garment Construction


CAMPers disassemble an old pair of blue jeans and up-cycle them into a messenger bag to warm up sewing and design muscles. Then, we’ll move onto garment construction. CAMPers create a custom garment based on their measurements. We’ll draft the pattern, create a muslin, and sew the final garment.
