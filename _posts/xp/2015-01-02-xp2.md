#Behemoths

Dinosaurs, monsters and beasts! Build creature sculptures as tall as yourself!

We’ll start by looking at dinosaur skeletons, and then build armatures out of wood, metal and plastic based on what we learn about bones. From there, it’s skin and surface painting. Make a watch-dragon for your front yard, or a velociraptor guard for your bedroom! We’ll be using a band saw, hand saws, drills, hammers and staple guns to create our new friends; you’ll be using your design and tool skills and learning some new ones, too. 

*Instructor:* David Dawson

*For CAMPers ages 11-14*
