**_Art Can Change the World_**

Together we will explore topics most important to each camper—the environment, equal rights, justice for all, peace,  healing the planet—anything that spark our passionate engagement with the world. After defining some area of interest campers learn simple silk screen, hand sewing, wheat paste and stencil printing techniques to make flags, banners, posters, zines and buttons and patches that share their passionate interest with visual language.
