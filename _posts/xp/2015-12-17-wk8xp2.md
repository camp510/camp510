##The Artist's Book

In this XP program, we will create a collaborative book from start to finish. Yes! a book in one short session. From planning , content, illustration, author bios, binding, and finishing, CAMPers will create a unique and beautiful book. 

CAMPers will decide on a topic or theme, stories, poems, prose, graphic stories and then create their content. CAMPers will hand-write and -illustrate work that will then be digitally transcribed. We will carve linoleum blocks, experiment with letterpress printing, and experiment with etching on acrylic plates.
