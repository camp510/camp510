### HACK: Repurpose
Don't toss it...Hack it!! To make better use of cast off items in our society, this group will explore the many beautiful and functional pieces that can be created from recycled materials. Using strips of old clothes, nylon netting, plastic bags and natural materials, we will make PLarn (plastic yarn), Tarn (T-shirt yarn), and use reclaimed yarn, to weave, crochet and make hats, totes, pouches, mats, clothes, and more... - lots of room for creative experimentation and design!
