*_Shoes, Bling and What's That?_*

**_Crazy Shoe Sculpture_**
How can you re-imagine a shoe? Will it be able to fly, roll, or spring? Can a shoe become an island, a garden, or a lion? Take a shoe and transform it! Students will imagine and draw their creations. First creating a contour drawing of their shoe, next planning how to take away and add to their creation, then building and making with plaster, paint, and reused materials. Finally, we will share stories about our shoe-sculptures.

**_Sew What?_** 
Bling! 
CAMPers will design and create jewelry using a variety of techniques including sewing, beading, and metalwork. We will create accessories such as wristbands and earrings, and CAMPers will have the opportunity to bling out a personal item such as a backpack, hat, or sneakers.
