##Thingamakids
Through interactive maker workshops that incorporate music, movement, visual art and science, CAMPers gain a unique and well-rounded experience in creativity, collaboration and experimentation. CAMPers explore and learn to discover random treasures wherever they are; hand-create their own engaging instruments and sound props out of recycled materials, and delve into the magic of performance as they combine creativity, musical expression and storytelling.
