Kalimba Building, Cooking, TBD


**_Kalimba Building_**
A kalimba, a.k.a. thumb piano, is an instrument inspired by plucked metal instruments such as mbira found throughout Africa. Over the course of the week, campers will create their own kalimbas, experimenting with design, tuning, and resonators. Along the way, we will learn about the musical origins of our homemade instruments.

**_Cooking_**
Peaches, strawberries, tomatoes, oh my! Experience the bounty of Bay Area summer food through hands-on cooking classes. CAMPers will begin to develop knife skills, learn to balance flavors, try new foods, and of course, there will be at least one day of baking. We focus on local and seasonal foods at CAMP 510, and the menus for each week reflect the optimum flavor and perfection of what is available.
