### BUGS, BIRDS AND BATS

In this painting & collage projects CAMPers will create artwork inspired by things that fly. Literature sources will include stories and facts about various creatures. Some of the projects will be creating painted papers and collages inspired by Eric Carle; mixed media watercolor paintings of insects; and Chinese ink brush paintings of California native birds.
