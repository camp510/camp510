####Kinetic Art, Bookbinding, TBD


###Fourth Dimension: Moving Art

Traditional art work can be fun to try, yet there are limitations to both 2d and 3d mediums. This project explores time, gravity, and building techniques, while adding an artistic flair. It will be unlike any art project that you have experienced before.

**_Artist/Maker:_** Alex Nolan


###Art Books

Book-binding is an exciting and important craft! CAMPers learn and practice several different methods of hand-bound bookmaking from simple single sheet 'instant books' to sewn books with chipboard covers. CAMPers immerse themselves in many aspects of the craft including design and implementation beginning with and build take-away skills and knowledge to continue at home.

**PLUS One Additional Project TBD**
