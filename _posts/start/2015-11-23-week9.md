##  Mix It Up: Media, Plarn, Thingamakids

**_Mixed Up Media_**
CAMPers get a chance to mix things up in this class.  We’ll use a variety of materials on different surfaces to create one of a kind art pieces. Techniques include sgraffito, collage, fabric painting, yarn painting, and maybe even sculptural if we’re inspired. Let’s see where our imaginations take us in this fun-filled class.

**_Creative Re-use_**
 Artists are experimenters and material manipulators. This week, CAMPers use strips of old clothes, nylon netting, plastic bags and natural materials, we will make PLarn (plastic yarn), Tarn (T-shirt yarn), and use reclaimed yarn, to weave, crochet and make hats, totes, pouches, mats, clothes, and more...

**_Thingamakids_**
Through interactive maker workshops that incorporate music, movement, visual art and science, CAMPers gain a unique and well-rounded experience in creativity, collaboration and experimentation. CAMPers explore and learn to discover random treasures wherever they are; hand-create their own engaging instruments and sound props out of recycled materials, and delve into the magic of performance as they combine creativity, musical expression and storytelling.
