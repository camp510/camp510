## Paper City, Baskets, 2-D Animation


**_Paper Cities_**
What does your dream town or city look like? Would you like more parks? More play areas? More car free roads and trails to bicycle and skate on?  This week, CAMPers are responsible for inventing the city they would want to love in. We will use cardboard, hot glue, paint, and a whole lot of imagination to plan, build, and name our dream city. At the end of the session, CAMPers take home their structures to display and hopefully continue building with at home.

**_2-D Animation_**
 CAMPers will learn to their animate their dreams! They will re-create a dream or memory in a video, learning creative ways to tell short stories through combining language with visual depictions. This project will help them visualize their information, make connections, and re-tell facts in story form. Then, students will use these stories to create short animations through drawing and collage.

**_Basket Making_** 
CAMPers start with a simple project to learn the basics of basket making and then move into solid wall forms, coiled, and woven baskets. Materials will include yarn, fabric, paper, pine needles, rattan, and whatever else our imaginations can weave together.
