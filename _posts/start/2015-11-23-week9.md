### Kinetic Art, Bookbinding, TBD


### Fourth Dimension: Moving Art

Traditional art work can be fun to try, yet there are limitations to both 2d and 3d mediums. This project explores time, gravity, and building techniques, while adding an artistic flair. It will be unlike any art project that you have experienced before.

### Lilliputian Art Books

In this session of bookmaking CAMPers will shrink themselves and immerse in miniature bookbinding. We will create a semi-traditional hardbound book and several versions of an accordion book. Most finished projects will measure no more than 3" tall!

### Capoeira

Capoeira is a dynamic expression of Afro-Brazilian culture. The game of capoeira derived from a variety of ceremonial dances and ritualized forms of combat, that most likely came from the western nations of Africa. Capoeira became an activity that drew together people of African descent, becoming a nucleus for maintaining African traditions in the Americas. From the 1900’s on, capoeira began to cross ethnic backgrounds and cultural borders. Today capoeira is an international activity practiced all over the world. It embodies the spirit of community and gives it’s practitioners a means to personal growth and liberation from social and personal constraints.
