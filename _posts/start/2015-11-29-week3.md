## Yum & Fun: Cooking, Sewing, Music

**Cooking**
In Kim's class the students will dive into the bounty of summer,focusing on seasonal, local produce. Together we will explore the ways flavors of specific vegetables can explode, recede, or change all together depending on how we play with them. We will also think about food over time: how did these fruits and vegetables come to be in our classroom and how can we work with them so that they last a moment or an entire month? We will work together as always interested in texture, surprise, and the simple beauty of the produce that we use to fuel our minds.

**Thingamakids**
Through interactive maker workshops that incorporate music, movement, visual art and science, Thingamakids! campers gain a unique and well-rounded experience in creativity, collaboration and experimentation. In each camp children explore and learn to discover random treasures in places like the beach, forests, and even their own recycling bins; hand-create their own engaging instruments and sound props out of recycled materials, and delve into the magic of performance as they combine creativity, musical expression and storytelling.
