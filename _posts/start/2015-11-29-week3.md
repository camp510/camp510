## Ceramics, Capoeira, TBD

**_Ceramics_** 
In this project, campers will be introduced to the basics of hand-building ceramic objects. We will experiment with form and texture by utilizing different techniques for building and surface design, including carving and using found objects to press into the clay surface. CAMPers are invited to explore and develop their creativity by taking their ideas from concept to realization in 3 dimensional form.

**_Capoeira_**
Capoeira is a dynamic expression of Afro-Brazilian culture. The game of capoeira derived from a variety of ceremonial dances and ritualized forms of combat, that most likely came from the western nations of Africa. Capoeira became an activity that drew together people of African descent, becoming a nucleus for maintaining African traditions in the Americas. From the 1900’s on, capoeira began to cross ethnic backgrounds and cultural borders. Today capoeira is an international activity practiced all over the world. It embodies the spirit of community and gives it’s practitioners a means to personal growth and liberation from social and personal constraints.
