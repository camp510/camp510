Sewing, Cooking, TBD


**_Sewing_**
CAMPers will learn to use sewing machines (or deepen their skills) to create functional and wearable artwork including a backpack, pillow monster and more!

**_Artist:_**Angie Wilson


**_Cooking_**
Peaches, strawberries, tomatoes, oh my! Experience the bounty of Bay Area summer food through hands-on cooking classes. CAMPers will begin to develop knife skills, learn to balance flavors, try new foods, and of course, there will be at least one day of baking. We focus on local and seasonal foods at CAMP 510, and the menus for each week reflect the optimum flavor and perfection of what is available.
