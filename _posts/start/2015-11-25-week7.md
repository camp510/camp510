##  Social Sculpture, Clay, Thingamakids


**_Social Sculpture / Reduce Reuse Refurnish !!_**
We will explore balance, weight, and aesthetics to construct unusual furniture out of used cardboard. By the end of the week we will have a banquet using the objects we've made.

**_CLAY_**
Students  will  first  learn  about  basic  methods  and  techniques  of  hand-­‐building clay sculpture, like coil, slab, pinch, and free-­‐form. They will also learn on how to use molds and stamps on clay, and finally how to bind parts to make a good structure for their work.
Sessions will emphasize student practice in which they will conceive, sculpt, and paint a sculpture of their own, utilizing the techniques they’ve learned.

**_Thingamakids_**
Through interactive maker workshops that incorporate music, movement, visual art and science, CAMPers gain a unique and well-rounded experience in creativity, collaboration and experimentation. CAMPers explore and learn to discover random treasures wherever they are; hand-create their own engaging instruments and sound props out of recycled materials, and delve into the magic of performance as they combine creativity, musical expression and storytelling.
