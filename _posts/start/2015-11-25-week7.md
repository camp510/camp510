## Zines, Wind Chimes, Chef's Table


**_The Zine Factory_**
A zine is a handmade mini magazine or comic about anything you want!  Using several different folding and binding techniques and inspired by several terrific creative prompts, rad music, and explorations around  camp for inspiration,  we will make several zines of favorite things, best stories, or  inspired moments. A final project will also include excerpts from EVERYONEâ€™S zine in a collaborative 510zine.

**_Wind Chimes:_** Upside down and Right-side Up
In this week-long sound exploration, CAMPers will find creative ways to reimagine wind chimes. Using a variety of found objects, we create hanging wind chimes. Inspired by sound artists such as Harry Bertoia and Kathy Hinde, we will then flip our wind chimes upside down, propping up metal rods in a bed of clay, each topped by sonically interested objects, to create an array of suspended chimes. What will yours sound like?
