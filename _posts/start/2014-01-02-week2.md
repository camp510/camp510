####Leather

In this week’s Leather Bag Project CAMPers will focus on functional design work to make bags with depth. CAMPers will have the option to make it a handbag, clutch, kit, or utility belt pack, and will be responsible for assembling and stretching their bags, as well as personalizing them with stamps, embossing, and dye work.

####Heroes & Heroines 

CAMPers create heroic cartoons characters. Drawing inspiration from Keith Haring, the Pixar movie The Incredibles, and mask traditions from around the world, CAMPers work on their own and collaboratively to develop ideas, explore camera angles, and create plaster masks  which will represent protection, disguise or transformation.

####Print Workshop

Explore the fun of printmaking! CAMPers will make stamps, collographs, sunprints, relief prints and more—getting to design cool images, and express their individuality through image. We’ll use the printing press and other fun tools to make gorgeous prints on paper, t-shirts, and other textiles.

*For CAMPers entering grades 1-5*
