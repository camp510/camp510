## Bookmaking, Mural Painting, 2D-3D

**_Paper and Books_**
Book binding is an exciting and important craft!! When children learn how to 'publish' their own drawings, art and writing, their enthusiasm for writing and literacy instruction rises. In this project, CAMPers learn several different methods of hand-bound book making, from simple 'instant books' to sewn books with chipboard covers.

**_Community Mural_**
Collaborative community art! We will use acrylic paint and wood panels to explore what community looks like to the campers. The panels will be assembled together for a group mural.

**_Painting and Sculpture_**
In **_Bugs, Birds, and Bats_** CAMPers will create art inspired by things that fly. Literature sources will include stories and facts about various creatures. We will paint and collage work inspired by Eric Carle; mixed media watercolor paintings of insects; and Chinese ink brush paintings of California native birds found at neighboring Lake Merritt. CAMPers will also construct a 3-D sculpture of an insect, bird, or bat.
