### Out n' About: Temporary Sculpture; Capoeira, Thingamakids

**Temporary Sculpture**
This week will be dedicated to the natural world around us. Campers will spend time outside of the classroom examining plants and trees, and searching for natural material to make art with. Students will also create temporary sculptures from objects they find during our outdoors adventures. Those sculptures will be documented by staff and then dismantled and all materials return to their original place.

**Capoeira**
Pincel

**Thingamakids**
Through interactive maker workshops that incorporate music, movement, visual art and science, CAMPers gain a unique and well-rounded experience in creativity, collaboration and experimentation. CAMPers explore and learn to discover random treasures wherever they are; hand-create their own engaging instruments and sound props out of recycled materials, and delve into the magic of performance as they combine creativity, musical expression and storytelling.



**$450**

*STart CAMP is open to CAMPers entering grades 1-5*
