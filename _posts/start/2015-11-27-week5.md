### Out n' About: Temporary Sculpture; Capoeira, Thingamakids

**Temporary Sculpture**
This week will be dedicated to the natural world around us. Campers will spend time outside of the classroom examining plants and trees, and searching for natural material to make art with. Students will also create temporary sculptures from objects they find during our outdoors adventures. Those sculptures will be documented by staff and then dismantled and all materials return to their original place.

**Capoeira**
Capoeira is an Afro Brazilian Art form that combines Martial Arts/Dance/Gymnastics/Music and singing. CAMPers will get to let loose and take their shoes off (literally) while we explore this unique art form of Capoeira. We will be learning the fundamentals movements during this class in a fun environment. By the end of the week, your child will be fight/dancing, and doing cartwheels all the way home

**Thingamakids**
Through interactive maker workshops that incorporate music, movement, visual art and science, CAMPers gain a unique and well-rounded experience in creativity, collaboration and experimentation. CAMPers explore and learn to discover random treasures wherever they are; hand-create their own engaging instruments and sound props out of recycled materials, and delve into the magic of performance as they combine creativity, musical expression and storytelling.
