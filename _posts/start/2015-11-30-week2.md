###Music&Video, Printmaking, Baking

###Explorations in Music, Movement and Video

_*with a focus on instruments and the magic of video played backwards_

CAMPers play many different instruments including drums, bells, ukeleles, guitars, mbiras, and singing bowls. We will put compositions together using a loop station to record different layers of instrumentation and vocals AND learn the magic of changing the direction of video using ourselves as actors. And, oh yeah!, we are also definitely going to be beatboxing! This project involves lots of active games, lots of listening, and making sounds to listen to.

###Drawing, Painting & Printmaking

CAMPers get a taste of different 2-D ways of expression as they paint, mix colors, and draw from life... and then turn their drawings into prints!!

###Cooking & Baking

In this week's cooking project with Terry Betts, we will be cooking outside in the cob oven (a wood fired oven our campers built three summers ago). CAMPers will make pizzas, pretzels, Parker House rolls and strawberry jam.
