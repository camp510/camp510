### Beatboxing & Video, Capoeira, Baking

### Explorations in Percussion, Movement and Video

Listen! and make music for others to listen to! Join us as we explore rhythms and learn the power of playing along to a beat. The focus this week will be percussion, stacking beats and rhythms, counting off...and Beatboxing!! CAMPers also explore the magic of time in video (speed). What if we video ourselves moving slowly and then play the video back fast? What about the other way around?

#### Capoeira

Capoeira is a dynamic expression of Afro-Brazilian culture. The game of capoeira derived from a variety of ceremonial dances and ritualized forms of combat, that most likely came from the western nations of Africa. Capoeira became an activity that drew together people of African descent, becoming a nucleus for maintaining African traditions in the Americas. From the 1900’s on, capoeira began to cross ethnic backgrounds and cultural borders. Today capoeira is an international activity practiced all over the world. It embodies the spirit of community and gives it’s practitioners a means to personal growth and liberation from social and personal constraints.
