####Beatboxing & Video, LEGO Machines, Cooking

###Explorations in Percussion, Movement and Video

Listen! and make music for others to listen to! Join us as we explore rhythms and learn the power of playing along to a beat. The focus this week will be percussion, stacking beats and rhythms, counting off...and Beatboxing!! CAMPers also explore the magic of time in video (speed). What if we video ourselves moving slowly and then play the video back fast? What about the other way around?

###Build LEGO Machines!

This week, CAMPers learn basic elements of how to build machines, developing or deepening an understanding for their different stages. We figure out how to link them together to build larger more complex structures. This project will be mainly LEGO based, but will also draw from a variety of other materials and resources. Note: CAMPer projects do not need to be made out of Lego or use magnets, and they can as big or small or as simple or as complex as meets the needs of the individual.

###Cooking

In this week's cooking project with Terry Betts, we will prepare delicious and iconic Summer treats such as strawberry cobbler, raspberry buttermilk cake and peach crepes with local produce from Blossom Bluff Orchards and Full Belly Farm.
