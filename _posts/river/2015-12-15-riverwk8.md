## Lagoon of the Tree People

Nothing stirs the imagination like the open ocean! Young architects and storytellers will work individually and together to create a society of people and creatures who live in elevated houses that hover over a mysterious and beautiful lagoon. Each child will devise a vertical landscape to include trees, trees-houses, aerial gardens, exotic birds,bird people, angels, fairies, scary creatures, mythological figures and mysterious elevated habitations. These architectural features will made using a variety of craft media using wood, paper, cardboard, clay, dyed plants, cleverly repurposed recycled materials and lots of tiny plastic play creatures. The expansive open ocean, replete with rain and currents encourages the improvisation of self propelled boats. The highly social and creative process involving art, craft, design and plenty of social play will culminate in a final floating exhibition for parents and friends after which each child will be able to take home their work to be played with and shared with others. 

 The project will culminate in a grand tour event in an expansive new “oceanopolis” format, after which architectural creations will be taken home to be further shared and enjoyed.
