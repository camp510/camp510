River Camp get's earthy this year! Partially inspired by Jules Vernesâ€™ Journey to the Center of the Earth, young architects and storytellers work individually and collaboratively to create a fantastic underground river landscape. Campers will learn about and practice skills in geology, biology, architecture, and design. The finished 35-foot river landscape will be the centerpiece for a Grand Tour for parents and friends!

A RIVER Runs Through CAMP twice this summer! runs July 13-24, and again July 27-August 7. River projects are two week projects and are limited to 18 campers ages 8-11. Applications are required, and can be filled out online. Once accepted your camper will be automatically registered.
