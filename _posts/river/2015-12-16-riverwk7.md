## Land of the Tree People

River Camp looks skyward this year! Young architects and storytellers will work individually and together to create a society of people and creatures who live along a river flanked by towering exotic tree-houses! Each child will devise a vertical landscape to include trees, trees-houses, areal gardens, exotic birds, bird people, angels, fairies, scary creatures, mythological figures and mysterious elevated habitations. These architectural features will made using a variety of craft media using wood, paper, cardboard, clay, dyed plants, cleverly repurposed recycled materials and lots of tiny plastic play creatures. Along the way campers will learn about architecture, design, and a smidgen of biology and geology. The highly social and creative process involving art, craft, design and plenty of social play will culminate in 35-foot river landscape will be the centerpiece for a Grand Tour for parents and friends! After the exhibition each child will be able to take home their work to be played with and shared with others.


NOTE: This camp presumes an interest in developing craft-skill and demands periods of collaboration, creative focus and self-direction. River CAMPers must be comfortable collaborating, as well as working independently.
