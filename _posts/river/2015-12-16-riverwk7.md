## Journey to the Center of the Earth

River Camp get's earthy this year! Inspired by Jules Vernesâ€™ classic, Journey to the Center of the Earth, young architects and storytellers will work individually and together to create a fantastic underground river landscape.   Each child will invent a "land" along the descending route which may be inhabited by animal communities, exotic gardens, lost tribes of humanity, fairly houses, mythological figures or secret hi-tech installations.  Real cascading water will flow down through a series of giant grotto's culminating in a vast underground sea! Along the way Campers will learn about geology, architecture, design and a bit of biology and geology. The finished 35-foot river landscape will be the centerpiece for a Grand Tour for parents and friends!


NOTE: This camp presumes an interest in developing craft-skill and demands periods of collaboration, creative focus and self-direction. River CAMPers must be comfortable collaborating, as well as working independently.
