## County Fair, Carnival & Circus

This summer each young architect will design and construct a unique contribution to our County Fair, Carnival & Circus!  Creating this whimsical universe together suggests a wide range of options from wild amusement park rides, circus wagons, haunted houses, art collections, show animals, agricultural displays, musical venues, futuristic intentions and more  . . . all this with a river running right through it!  Along the way campers will learn about architecture, design, storytelling and tackle some hands-on science and engineering. The finished 35-foot river landscape will be the centerpiece for a Grand Tour for parents and friends!


NOTE: This camp presumes an interest in developing craft-skill and demands periods of collaboration, creative focus and self-direction. River CAMPers must be comfortable collaborating, as well as working independently.
