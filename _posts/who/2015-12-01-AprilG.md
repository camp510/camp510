**April** returns to CAMP 510 this year with even more artful sewing projects.  She learned to sew at the age of 5 by converting hand-me-downs into one of a kind garments. Her current work includes mixed media textile forms.  Her work has been shown at the Olive Hyde Gallery, Berkeley Art Center, and The San Luis Obispo Museum of Art. She enjoys teaching both children and adults and sews for theater and private clients.
