His site specific project called “Riveropolis,” was born out of his interest in bringing inner-city people together in a man-made environment reminiscent of nature.

He’s been commissioned by the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the de Young Museum, and has piloted summer camps for the Bay Area Discovery Museum and MOCHA.

**Lori Now** "I studied painting at Pratt Institute and have worked in special effects and animation in the commercial art world.  My art inspires me to create innovative lessons and techniques, teaching that art is about growing through the process, not only about producing a product. Additionally, I enjoy collaborating on projects: some recent collaborations included set design and digital art.""
