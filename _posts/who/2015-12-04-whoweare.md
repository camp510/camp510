**Aliza Cord** is a Bay Area artist and writer. Her work explores the connections between our inner and outer lives and the spaces of transition between the two.

She has studied studio art at the Education Alliance in New York City, Richmond Arts Center in Richmond, CA, City College of San Francisco, and has a BFA from Mills College in Oakland.

**Dave Dawson** has been making things all his life. Following his interests where they lead him has afforded him a variety of occasionally wacky opportunities to apply and acquire skills and creative thought. Dave has produced fashion shows, painted dancers at Lollapalooza, apprenticed with a bronze sculptor and built a 25 foot-long desk out of Bondo, to name a few interesting projects. Dave loves to teach, and strives to enhance students’ abilities to bring original thinking and artistic experience to the things they do every day.

**April Gavin** returns to CAMP 510 this year with even more artful sewing projects.  She learned to sew at the age of 5 by converting hand-me-downs into one of a kind garments. Her current work includes mixed media textile forms.  Her work has been shown at the Olive Hyde Gallery, Berkeley Art Center, and The San Luis Obispo Museum of Art.

**Gregory Gavin** is a visual artist with a social cause. His site specific project called “Riveropolis,” was born out of his interest in bringing inner-city people together in a man-made environment reminiscent of nature. With this project, Gavin hopes to create a meeting place for people in much the same way as a watering hole found in nature is a meeting places for animals. He’s been commissioned by the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the de Young Museum, and has piloted summer camps for the Bay Area Discovery Museum and MOCHA.

**Helena Keeffe** is a San Francisco-based artist, teacher and cook who brings these identities together in projects that invite others to step with her into unfamiliar territory.

**Lori Now** "I studied painting at Pratt Institute and have worked in special effects and animation in the commercial art world.  My art inspires me to create innovative lessons and techniques, teaching that art is about growing through the process, not only about producing a product. Additionally, I enjoy collaborating on projects: some recent collaborations included set design and digital art.""
