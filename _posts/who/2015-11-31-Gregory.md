**Gregory Gavin** is a visual artist with a social cause. His site specific project called “Riveropolis,” was born out of his interest in bringing inner-city people together in a man-made environment reminiscent of nature. With this project, Gavin hopes to create a meeting place for people in much the same way as a watering hole found in nature is a meeting places for animals. He’s been commissioned by the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, the de Young Museum, and has piloted summer camps for the Bay Area Discovery Museum and MOCHA.
