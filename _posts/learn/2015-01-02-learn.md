category: learn
---

CAMP 510 exists to cultivate a community of makers who have the creative agency and confidence to help shape a better world. Seems rather revolutionary, and yes we believe that our children are capable and that they are inspired by opportunities to engage, learn and grow through their own creative and intelligent prowess. Here at CAMP 510, your child explores the innovative and magical in studio art, tinkering, public art, food and cooking, movement, building, soldering and welding, sewing, crafts, music, and more. Unique projects are carefully chosen for each week of CAMP and are scaled to be developmentally appropriate for each age group of CAMPers. Equipped with the right tools in a participatory community environment, these projects are led by professional artists, makers, performers, gardeners, teachers, and chefs in the spirit of D-I-T (do it together). CAMP 510 is located on the Park Day School campus in Temescal, Oakland. (*Campers must be 6 years old by or before their first day at CAMP)
