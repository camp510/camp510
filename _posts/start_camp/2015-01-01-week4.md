title: Week 4 (July 6-10)&#58; Cubism & Cooking
category: start_camp
---

Dive into a world where three dimensions overlap with two as we explore non-traditional still lives. Gathering inspiration from the cubist painters, the photographs of Daniel Gordon, and the web’s never-ending stream of images, we will paint, collage, and build a still life that projects off the wall into space. Working individually and collaboratively, the week’s work will culminate in a large-scale work of art to be shared with other CAMPers and their families. Instructor: Rebecca Rau With Mestre Pincel, CAMPers will learn and/or deepen their Capoeira repertoire. (A Mestre is more than an instructor, teaching of course the technical aspects of capoeira and also its spirit, music and history.) Capoeira is a rich African-Brazilian hybrid martial art form with dance-like moves, ritual, music, and culture. It is often referenced as a movement game. The week will culminate in a showcase performance of movement and music and community. Comfort Cooking with Terry Betts. CAMPers make delicious and not so basic comfort foods this week like local summer fruit crumble and homemade ice cream; soft pretzels, latkes and more.   For CAMPers ages 6-10.
